# Readme

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to gather demographic data from an anonymized participant data file from an EEG study and run some basic statistical tests to ensure matched groups, as well as determine if there were any basic correlations between behavioral (questionnaire) data and EEG data.

## Demographics
The demographics file pulls the necessary information from the behavioral data set as well as from several EEG data sets. It combines them when necessary, runs the required t-tests, Wilcox tests or correlation tests and outputs the results to a summary file, which can then be tidied up and used to present the final data.

## Correlations
Basic correlation tests were run between the behavioral data and EEG data, with a regression along a general linear model.
